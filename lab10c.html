            <h2>How I Installed Vue.js</h2>
            <p>To install Vue.js, I decided to include it via a CDN in the <code>&lt;head&gt;</code> section of my HTML file. This approach is simple and doesn't require setting up a complex build environment. Here is the script tag I added:</p>
            <pre>&lt;script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/vue@2"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;</pre>
            <p>By using this method, I was able to easily integrate Vue.js into my project without the need for a package manager like npm.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
            <h2>How I Built the Page</h2>
            <p>I began by creating a basic HTML structure and including Vue.js via the CDN. In the <code>&lt;body&gt;</code> section, I created a <code>&lt;div&gt;</code> with the id of <code>app</code>, which would serve as the root element for the Vue instance:</p>
            <pre>&lt;div id="app"&gt;...&lt;/div&gt;</pre>
            <p>Inside this div, I used Vue's data binding to display dynamic content. For example, the <code>&lt;h1&gt;</code> tag binds to a data property <code>title</code> in Vue.js:</p>
            <pre>&lt;h1&gt;{{ title }}&lt;/h1&gt;</pre>
            <p>Here is the Vue.js instance initialization that I placed at the end of the <code>&lt;body&gt;</code> section:</p>
            <pre>
&lt;script&gt;
    new Vue({
        el: '#app',
        data: {
            title: 'Lab10c - Building a Web Page with Vue.js'
        }
    });
&lt;/script&gt;
            </pre>
            <p>This simple setup allows me to bind the <code>title</code> property to the HTML, dynamically rendering the page content.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
            <h2>Difficulties Encountered</h2>
            <p>One challenge I faced was that the Vue instance wasn't binding correctly to the DOM elements. After some investigation, I realized the issue was that the Vue script was loading before the DOM was fully parsed. I solved this by moving the Vue instance initialization code to the bottom of the <code>&lt;body&gt;</code> section to ensure that the DOM was ready before Vue.js took over.</p>
            <p>Another issue I encountered was understanding how Vue's reactivity system works. Initially, I wasnâ€™t fully aware of how data changes would automatically update the DOM. After reading the documentation and experimenting, I gained a better understanding of Vue's reactive nature.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
            <h2>Hosting</h2>
            <p>I hosted this web page on GitHub Pages, which provides free static website hosting. Since Vue.js is a client-side framework, I can use it with a static hosting service like GitHub Pages without needing a backend. GitHub Pages only serves static files, so there was no need to configure a server-side environment or use complex build tools. All I needed was to push my HTML file to a GitHub repository and enable GitHub Pages to serve the content.</p>
            <p>By using Vue.js from a CDN, I was able to create a dynamic, interactive web page that functions fully on the client side, without the need for server-side processing or complex deployment steps.</p>
